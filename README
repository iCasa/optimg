optimg
-------

A PHP class for optimizing images using best practice. It also includes a CLI interface that you can use for build or commit check. Yahoo! has a similar tool called [Smush.it](http://www.smushit.com/ysmush.it/). This tool basicly provides the same functionality as it.

## Usage

```
Usage: optimg [options] image_path

  -c, --check-only   Check if path has fully optimized.
  -r, --report-only  Show report without really optimization.
  --png8             Transform all PNG files to PNG8 format.
```
